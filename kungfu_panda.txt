DreamWorks Animation Skg. DreamWorks Animation Presents. Kung Fu Panda. Legend tells of a legendary warrior,
whose kung fu skills
were the stuff of legend.
He travelled the land
in search of worthy foes.
I see you like to chew.
Maybe you should chew on my fist!
The warrior said nothing
for his mouth was full.
Then he swallowed.
And then he spoke.
Enough talk. Let's fight.
He was so deadly in fact,
that his enemies will go blind,
from over exposure to pure
awesomeness.
My eyes!
He's too awesome!
And attractive.
How can we re-pay you?
There is no charge for awesomeness.
Or attractiveness.
It mattered not how many foes he faced.
They were no match for his voracity.
Never before had a panda
been so feared, and so loved.
Even the most heroic heroes
in all of China,
The Furious Five.
Bowed in respect to this great master.
We should hang out?
Agreed.
But hanging out would
have to wait.
Cause when you're facing the ten
thousand demons of demon mountain.
There is only one thing
that matters and thats...
Po.
Get up!
You'll be late for work.
What?
Po...
Get up!
Hey, Po.
What are you doing up there?
Ahh.. nothing.
Monkey, Mantis, Crane, Viper,
Tigress ... Roarrrr!
Ahh...
Po. Let's go.
You're late for work.
Coming!
Sorry Dad.
Sorry, doesn't make the Noodles.
What were you doing up there?
All that noise?
Oh...nothing.
Just had a crazy dream.
About what? Uh?
What were you dreaming about?
What was I...aah...
... I was dreaming about a...
Noodles.
Noodles?
You were really dreaming about noodles?
Uhh... Ya,
what else would I be dreaming about?
Oh, careful.
That soup is - sharp.
Oh... happy day.
My son finally having the noodle dream.
You don't know how long
I have been waiting for this moment.
This is a sign, Po.
Uh... a sign of what?
You are almost ready to be
entrusted with the secret ingredient,
... of my secret ingredient soup.
And then you will fulfill your destiny
and take over the restaurant.
Just as I took over from my father
who took over from his father.
who won it from a friend
over a game of mahjong.
Dad, dad, dad.
It was just a dream.
No, it was the Dream.
Wu Xiang noodles.
Po, broth runs through our veins.
But Dad, didn't you ever
wanted to do something else?
Something, beside noodles.
Actually, when I was young
and crazy.
I thought of running away
and learning how to make tofu.
So why didn't you?
Oh, because it was
a stupid dream.
Can you imagine me making tofu?
Ha, ha, ha. Tofu!
No, we all have our place
in this world.
My is here and yours is...
... I know "is here".
No, its tables 2, 5 ,7 and 12.
Service with a smile.
Well done, students...
... if you were trying
to disappoint me.
Tigress, you need more ferocity.
Monkey greater speed.
Crane, height. Viper, subtlety.
Mantis... Master Shifu...
Master Shifu... What?
It...its Master Oogway,
he wants to see you.
Master Oogway, you summoned me?
Is something wrong?
Why must something be wrong
for me to want to see my old friend?
So, nothing is wrong?
Well, I didn't say that.
You were saying?
I have had a vision.
Tai Lung will return.
That is impossible!
He's in prison.
Nothing is impossible.
Zeng! fly to Chorgom Prison.
Tell them to double the guards.
Double the weapons.
Double everything.
Tai Lung does not leave
that prison.
Yes, Master Shifu.
One often meets his destiny on
the road he takes to avoid it.
We have to do something. We can't
just have him march in the valley.
And take his revenge.
He'll, he'll...
Your mind is like this water
my friend. When it is agitated...
